Note to self:
Use this file as temp placeholder for working out any logic, 
code snippets, or other notes as needed to aid yourself 
in the creation of the app, then delete text when ready 
to implement into the final working code.


what was the purpose of the "touched" property??? it was causing an error in "AddNote"
is it needed elsewhere????
